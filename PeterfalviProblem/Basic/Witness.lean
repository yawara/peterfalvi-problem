# BG Appendix C: the hypotheses (A) and (B) of Theorem C

H. Bender and G. Glauberman, *Local Analysis for the Odd Order Theorem*
(LMS LNS 188, 1994), Appendix C, §1 (p. 145).

Theorem C reads: *let `p` and `q` be two primes satisfying condition*

> **(A)** `((p^q - 1)/(p - 1), p - 1) = 1`.

*Let `P` be the additive group of `𝔽_{p^q}` and `U` the subgroup of `𝔽_{p^q}ˣ` consisting of the
elements of norm one over `𝔽_p`.  The subgroup `U` acts on `P` by multiplication and we can form
the semidirect product `H = PU`.  Let `P₀` be the image in `P` of the additive group of `𝔽_p`.
Furthermore, suppose that there is a group `G` such that hypothesis (B) below holds.*

> **(B)** *There is a monomorphism `σ : H → G`, a finite abelian `p'`-subgroup `Q` of `G`, and an
> element `y ∈ Q` such that `σ(P₀)` normalizes `Q` and `σ(P₀)^y` normalizes `U`.*

*Then `p ≤ q`.*

This file carries the two hypotheses in the book's `p, q, G`-abstract form.  It sits **upstream**
of both the Peterfalvi Section 16 development (which supplies a concrete instance of (B) along the
Feit–Thompson spine) and of `PeterfalviProblem.BG.AppC_FinalContradiction` (which assembles Theorem C), so
that the Lemma C.1--C.3 machinery can be stated against these hypotheses rather than against the
Section 16 configuration.

## Main definitions

* `conditionA p q` — condition (A).
* `primeLine p q` — the prime-field line `P₀ ≤ P ≤ H`.
* `HypothesisBAbstract p q G` — hypothesis (B).

## Implementation notes

`H = PU` is `normOneFrobeniusGroup p q`, `P` is `normOneFrobeniusKernel p q` and
`U` is `normOneFrobeniusComplement p q`.  Following the book's Remark (VI) ("we will
identify `H` with its image in `G`"), the two normalizer clauses of (B) are stated for the
*images* `σ(P₀)` and `σ(U)`.

/-- **BG Appendix C, Hypothesis (B)** (p. 145), in the book's `p, q, G`-abstract form: no
Peterfalvi Section 16 configuration anywhere in the statement.

Verbatim: *"There is a monomorphism `σ : H → G`, a finite abelian `p'`-subgroup `Q` of `G`, and an
element `y ∈ Q` such that `σ(P₀)` normalizes `Q` and `σ(P₀)^y` normalizes `U`."*  Here
`H = P ⋊ U` is `normOneFrobeniusGroup p q`, `P₀` is `primeLine p q`, and `U` is
identified with its image `σ(U)` inside `G` (Remark (VI)).

The conjugation is written `MulAut.conj y • σ(P₀) = y σ(P₀) y⁻¹`; since `Q` is a subgroup,
feeding it `y⁻¹` recovers the book's `σ(P₀)^y = y⁻¹ σ(P₀) y` verbatim, so the two readings define
the same hypothesis.

The concrete Peterfalvi Section 16 instance of (B) along the Feit--Thompson spine is
`PeterfalviProblem.Peterfalvi.S16.FieldNormalizerData`.  What is still missing to run Theorem C off the
abstract form is the implication *(B) ⟹ `hrel`* (BG Lemma C.3), currently available only through
Section 16; see issue 0151.

`hypothesisBAbstract_sl2` (in `PeterfalviProblem.BG.AppC_SL2Example`) is the book's Remark (II) witness,
showing this hypothesis is satisfiable (`p = 2`, `G = SL(2, 2^q)`). -/

variable {p q : ℕ} [Fact p.Prime] {G : Type*} [Group G]

/-- **Field-normalizer data**: hypothesis (B) together with condition (A), with the three
subgroups `σ(P)`, `σ(U)`, `σ(P₀)` given names.

This is the shape in which the Lemma C.1--C.3 development consumes Theorem C's hypotheses: the
proofs constantly refer to the ambient subgroups `P = σ(P)`, `U = σ(U)` and `W₂ = σ(P₀)` of `G`,
so it is convenient to carry them as fields with their defining equations rather than to unfold
`Subgroup.map` everywhere.

The packaging adds **nothing**: `HypothesisBAbstract.toFieldNormalizerData` builds it from (B)
and (A) alone, taking the three subgroups to be literally the images (all three equations are
`rfl`).  So a `FieldNormalizerData` is exactly "(A) and (B)". -/
