# BG Appendix C, Problem 1: the group-theoretic core

Bender--Glauberman, *Local Analysis for the Odd Order Theorem*, Appendix C, p. 152, Problem 1
(= Glauberman--Norton, Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. **119** (1993), p. 1094, "Problem (Péterfalvi)"):

> Can the hypothesis of Proposition 9 be satisfied for `p = 3`?

This was open since 1993 and is now **resolved negatively** (2026-08-13): the final,
machine-checked answer is `hypothesisB_false` in `AppC_Problem1SkewEndgame.lean`
(all `q`, no finiteness assumption on `G`; master document
`notes/bg/appC_problem1_resolution.md`).  What this file carries are the two elementary
group-theoretic steps that seeded the resolution — Theorem 1 (the Frobenius-power case,
still the live endpoint for `e ∈ ⟨3⟩` and hence all of `q = 3`) and the engine behind it —
first recorded in `notes/bg/appC_problem1_partial_resolution.md` (issue 0180):

* **Lemma A′** (`pow_three_mul_eq_pow_three_of_commute`): if `x³ = 1` and `c` commutes with its
  conjugate `x⁻¹cx`, then `(x * c * x)³ = (x * c)³`.  Both sides expand to the three conjugates
  `c^{x²}`, `c^x`, `c` in opposite orders, so one commutation identifies them.

  Applied to a witness of hypothesis (B) with `x` a generator of `σ(P₀)`, `g = x^y` and
  `c = x⁻¹g = ⁅x, y⁆ ∈ Q`, this reads `(g * x)³ = g³ = 1`: since `Q` is *abelian* the hypothesis
  is automatic.  So (B) forces the product of the two order-three elements `g` and `x` to have
  order dividing three again — the single non-trivial relation that (B) yields, and the seed of
  everything downstream.

* **Lemma C** (`cross_commute_of_three_relations`): a pure cancellation.  Three "layered"
  relations `a₂a₁a₀ = 1`, `b₂b₁b₀ = 1`, `(a₂b₂)(a₁b₁)(a₀b₀) = 1` together with the two same-layer
  commutations force the *cross-layer* commutation `a₁b₀ = b₀a₁`.

  In the application the layers are `P`, `P^g`, `P^{g²}`, the three relations are the
  `σ(U)`-conjugates of `(g * x)³ = 1` taken at `s`, `t` and `s + t` inside the set `S` of squares
  of `𝔽_{3^q}`, and the same-layer commutations hold because each layer is abelian.  The
  conclusion is the vanishing cross-commutator `⁅t, (s^e)^g⁆ = 1` that drives the partial
  resolution.

## Main results

* `pow_three_mul_eq_pow_three_of_commute` — Lemma A′.
* `pow_three_mul_pow_three_eq_one` — the form used downstream: `(g * x)³ = 1`.
* `conj_mul_pow_three_eq_one` — the same relation read off a witness of hypothesis (B).
* `inv_mul_pow_three_eq_one_of_commute_conj` — Theorem 1's last mile: once `x` commutes with
  `x^g`, the element `c = x⁻¹g` satisfies `c³ = 1`, so `c = 1` in the `3′`-group `Q`.
* `cross_commute_of_three_relations` — Lemma C.
* `eq_one_of_closure_eq_top`, `eq_top_of_generators_mem` — the two abstract steps of Theorem 2,
  assembled in `commutator_eq_top_of_relations`: for an exponent that is not a Frobenius power
  the three layers die in `N^{ab}`, so `N` is perfect.
* `commute_conj_of_le_closure_twisted` — Theorem 1's engine (Frobenius-twisted form), with
  `commute_conj_of_le_closure` its untwisted specialisation: the relation family plus a spanning
  set makes the cross-commutator vanish.
* `injective_pow_mul_pow` — the `3q` exponents of Lemma D are pairwise distinct.
* `injective_pow_mul`, `injective_pow_mul_pow`, `injective_powHom_pow_mul_pow` — Lemma D: the
  coset separation, the resulting distinctness of the `3q` exponents, and the wiring that turns
  it into the hypothesis of `PeterfalviProblem.PowerMonomial.eq_zero_of_forall_trace_sum_eq_zero`.
* `commutator_layerClosure_eq_top` — **Theorem 2 in the ambient group**: the layered relation
  family plus the spanning of the relation lattice makes `⟨P, P^g, P^{g²}⟩` perfect, so a witness
  with a non-Frobenius exponent forces the ambient group to be non-solvable.
* `false_of_centralizing_of_spanning` — **Theorem 1 (centralising case), assembled**: no witness
  exists, given only the Paley-type spanning hypothesis (Lemma B).
* `le_closure_orbitS` — Lemma B, transported into `G`, which discharges that hypothesis; hence
  `false_of_centralizing` — **Theorem 1, unconditional**.

`x⁻¹cx`.  Then

`(x * c * x)³ = (x * c)³`.

Indeed both sides equal `c^{x²} · c^x · c` up to the order of the last two factors:
`(x * c)³ = c^{x²} c^{x} c` and `(x * c * x)³ = c^{x²} c c^{x}`.

This is the first step of the partial resolution of BG Appendix C, Problem 1: for a witness of
hypothesis (B) one takes `c = ⁅x, y⁆`, which lies in the abelian subgroup `Q`, so the commutation
hypothesis is free and the conclusion says `(g * x)³ = g³` for `g = x * c`. -/

`(x⁻¹ g)³ = 1`.

Since `x⁻¹g = ⁅x, y⁆` lies in the `3′`-group `Q` for a witness of hypothesis (B), this forces
`x⁻¹g = 1`, i.e. `g = x` — and `⟨g⟩` normalizes `σ(U)` whereas `⟨x⟩` does not.  That is the final
contradiction of Theorem 1.

The computation: `(g x)³ = 1` says `x^{g²} · x^g · x = 1`, so also `x · x^{g²} · x^g = 1` after a
cyclic shift; commuting the last two factors (the hypothesis, conjugated by `g`) gives

variable {a₀ a₁ a₂ b₀ b₁ b₂ : G}

/-- **Lemma C** (the cancellation behind the partial resolution of BG Appendix C, Problem 1).

Suppose three "layered" relations hold,

* `a₂ * a₁ * a₀ = 1`,
* `b₂ * b₁ * b₀ = 1`,
* `(a₂ * b₂) * (a₁ * b₁) * (a₀ * b₀) = 1`,

and that same-layer elements commute, `a₁ * b₁ = b₁ * a₁` and `a₀ * b₀ = b₀ * a₀`.  Then the
*cross-layer* pair commutes as well: `a₁ * b₀ = b₀ * a₁`.

Solving the first two relations for the top layer turns the third into
`(a₁b₁)(a₀b₀) = (b₁b₀)(a₁a₀)`; cancelling `b₁` on the left and `a₀` on the right — each licensed
by one of the same-layer commutations — leaves exactly `a₁b₀ = b₀a₁`.

In the application the three layers are `P`, `P^g` and `P^{g²}` for an element `g` of order three,
and the three relations are the `σ(U)`-conjugates of `(g * x)³ = 1` evaluated at `s`, `t` and
`s + t` in the set of squares of `𝔽_{3^q}`; the hypotheses hold because each layer is abelian and
because conjugation is additive on `P`. -/

section Semilinear

/-- **Semilinearity of the layer map.**  Suppose `g` normalizes a subgroup with exponent `e`, in
the sense `g · v = vᵉ · g`.  Then conjugating the `g`-layer by `v` shifts the base point by `vᵉ`:

`(z^g)^v = (z^{vᵉ})^g`.

This is the rule that produces the relation family for a *non-centralising* action: conjugating
`x^{g²} · x^g · x = 1` by `v ∈ σ(U)` gives

`(x^{v^{e²}})^{g²} · (x^{v^e})^g · x^v = 1`,

the twisted relation `R(s)` of the partial resolution.  For `e = 1` it degenerates to the plain
statement that conjugation by `v` commutes with the layer map, which is what
`pow_three_mul_conj_eq_one` uses. -/

Let `data` be a witness of BG Appendix C, hypothesis (B), let `x = σ(1)` be the distinguished
generator of `σ(P₀)` (`FieldNormalizerData.s`) and let `g = x^y` be its conjugate by the element
`y ∈ Q`, so that `⟨g⟩ = σ(P₀)^y` is the subgroup (B) requires to normalize `σ(U)`.  Then

`(g * x)³ = 1`.

Both `g` and `x` have order three, so the assertion is that their *product* again has order
dividing three.  Nothing else about (B) is used downstream: conjugating this one relation by
`σ(U)` produces the whole family that drives the partial resolution of Problem 1 recorded in
`notes/bg/appC_problem1_partial_resolution.md`.

The proof is `pow_three_mul_pow_three_eq_one` applied to `c = x⁻¹g = ⁅x, y⁆`: since `x`
normalizes `Q` and `y ∈ Q` the element `c` lies in `Q`, and `Q` is abelian, so `c` commutes with

/-- **Theorem 1, assembled.**  In a witness of hypothesis (B) with `p = 3`, the generator
`x = σ(1)` of `σ(P₀)` cannot commute with its conjugate `x^g`, where `g = x^y` generates
`σ(P₀)^y`.

This is everything of Theorem 1 except the production of the relation family (conjugating
`(g x)³ = 1` by `σ(U)`) and the Paley-type spanning lemma: given those,
`commute_conj_of_le_closure_twisted` supplies the commutation and this theorem closes the
argument.  The chain here is `(g x)³ = 1` (from (B)) → `(x⁻¹g)³ = 1` (the last mile) →
`x⁻¹g = 1` (because `Q` is a `3′`-group) → `g = x`, which is absurd since `⟨g⟩` normalizes `σ(U)`
while `x` does not (`FieldNormalizerData.s_not_normalizes_U`). -/

section TheoremTwo

/-! ### The abelianisation step behind Theorem 2

For an exponent `e` that is *not* a power of the Frobenius, the elimination of Lemma C is
unavailable (the map `s ↦ s^e` is no longer additive).  What replaces it is a dimension count.
Writing `π_i` for the three layer maps `V → N^{ab}`, `v ↦ ⟦v^{gⁱ}⟧`, the relation

`(s^{e²})^{g²} · (s^e)^g · s = 1   (s ∈ S)`

becomes `π₀ s + π₁ s^e + π₂ s^{e²} = 0`, so the linear form `Φ(a, b, c) = π₀a + π₁b + π₂c`
annihilates the *relation lattice* `L_e` spanned by the triples `(s, s^e, s^{e²})`.  When
`L_e` is everything — which happens exactly when `e` is not a Frobenius power — the form `Φ`
vanishes identically, all three layers die in `N^{ab}`, and `N` is therefore perfect.

The two abstract steps of that argument are `eq_zero_of_closure_eq_top` and
`eq_top_of_generators_mem`. -/

end TheoremTwo

section TheoremOne

/-- **Theorem 1's engine** (twisted form).  Let `P` be an abelian subgroup, `g` an element with
`σ` an endomorphism preserving `P`, and `S ⊆ P` a set of elements satisfying the *layered*
relation

`(σ²s)^{g²} · (σs)^g · s = 1`.

Fix `t ∈ S`.  If `σ` maps the elements `s ∈ S` with `s · t ∈ S` onto a generating set of `P`, then

`t · v^g = v^g · t` for every `v ∈ P`.

For each admissible `s` the three relations at `s`, `t` and `s · t` feed
`cross_commute_of_three_relations` — the middle layers multiply correctly because `σ` is a
homomorphism — and the elements commuting with `t` after conjugation form a subgroup, so a
generating set suffices.

In the application `P` is the additive group of `𝔽_{3^q}`, `S` the set of squares, `t = 1`, and
`σ` a power of the Frobenius: that is exactly the case `e ∈ ⟨3⟩` of the partial resolution, where
`s ↦ s^e` is additive.  `commute_conj_of_le_closure` is the untwisted specialisation `σ = id`
(the centralising case `e = 1`, available for every `q`). -/

section CosetSeparation

/-! ### The combinatorial half of Lemma D

Whether the relation lattice `L_e` is all of `V³` is decided by a coset computation.  Expanding
the trace turns the annihilator condition into a vanishing combination of power monomials
`a ↦ a^{d·3ʲ}` with `d ∈ {1, e, e²}`, and the exponents involved run through the three cosets
`⟨3⟩`, `e⟨3⟩`, `e²⟨3⟩` of the Frobenius subgroup.  Cosets are equal or disjoint, and since
`e² = e⁻¹` the three are pairwise disjoint precisely when `e ∉ ⟨3⟩`.  That is the content of
`injective_pow_mul` and `injective_pow_mul_pow` below; combined with
`PeterfalviProblem.PowerMonomial.eq_zero_of_forall_trace_sum_eq_zero` it gives Lemma D. -/

Through `mem_orbitS_iff` and `mem_normOneUnits_iff_isSquare` the generating set is the image of

additive group by `PeterfalviProblem.Paley.addClosure_paleySet_eq_top`.  Condition (A) supplies the two
