# Additive subgroups of a field that are closed under inversion

An additive subgroup `W` of a field which is also closed under inversion is very rigid: after
rescaling by any nonzero `s ∈ W`, it becomes a *subring*.  The mechanism is **Hua's identity**

`x - (x⁻¹ + (y - x)⁻¹)⁻¹ = x² / y`,

which expresses `x² / y` using only additions and inversions, so `W` is closed under `(x, y) ↦
x²/y`.  Taking `y = s` shows that `K = {v : s * v ∈ W}` is closed under squaring, and in
characteristic three `u * v = u² + v² - (u + v)²` turns that into closure under multiplication.

## Where this is used

This is the algebraic core of the *same-coset obstruction* for BG Appendix C, Problem 1
(`notes/bg/appC_problem1_partial_resolution.md`, issue 0180).  There one shows that

`W = {s : x and the second-layer element b(s t^E) commute for every t}`

is an additive subgroup closed under `s ↦ s⁻¹`.  Since `𝔽_{3^q}` with `q` prime has no
intermediate subfield, `W` is then forced to be either the prime field — which pins the collision
value to `-1` and makes its trace non-zero — or all of `𝔽_{3^q}`, which makes the two layers
centralise each other and contradicts the perfectness of `N`.  Either way no witness survives, and
crucially *no* hypothesis on the trace is needed.

## Main results

* `hua_identity` — `x - (x⁻¹ + (y - x)⁻¹)⁻¹ = x² / y`.
* `sq_div_mem` — an inversion-closed additive subgroup is closed under `(x, y) ↦ x² / y`.
* `scaledSubring` — `{v : s * v ∈ W}` as a `Subring`, in characteristic three.
* `scaledSubfield` — the same, as a `Subfield`; `eq_smul_scaledSubfield` recovers `W = s • K`.
* `subfield_eq_bot_or_top` — a finite field of prime degree has no intermediate subfield.
* `pow_four_eq_one_or_forall_mem` — **the dichotomy**: in `𝔽_{3^q}` with `q` prime such a `W`
  either is everything, or has `s ^ 4 = 1` for each of its nonzero elements.

/-! ### No intermediate subfield in prime degree

`𝔽_{p^q}` with `q` prime has only the two obvious subfields, because a subfield has `p^d` elements
with `d ∣ q`.  Combined with the previous subsection this pins an inversion-closed additive
subgroup down completely. -/

/-- **The punchline.**  In a finite field of characteristic three whose degree over the prime
field is prime, an inversion-closed additive subgroup `W` with a nonzero element `s` either
exhausts the field, or satisfies `s ^ 4 = 1` — in which case `W = s · 𝔽₃` with `s = ±1`, i.e.
`W` is the prime field.

This is exactly the dichotomy the same-coset obstruction of issue 0180 needs. -/
